The beauty of each letter (case-insensitive) is an integer between 1 and 26, inclusive, and no two letters have the same beauty.

You found the string that Johnny considered most beautiful. What is the maximum possible beauty of this string?
 
Input
Single integer m followed by m lines.
 
Output
For each test case, a line containing the string "Case #x: y" where x is the case number starting from 1, and y is the maximum beauty for that test case.
