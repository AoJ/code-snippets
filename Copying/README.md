A program has to be copied to N computers. At the moment the program is installed only on one computer (one of the N computers). The only way to transfer information from one computer to another is to copy it using a cable that connects two computers directly. So, if the program is installed on a computer, it can be copied to some other (but only one) computer within an hour. There are only K cables.
**Input**
The only input line contains two integers separated with a space: N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9).
**Output**
Minimal time (in hours) necessary to copy the program to all computers.
